This is version 0.0.0.9000 of dmrscaler package
preprint of associated paper available on BioRxiv at: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.428187 

Package is in development. As the author's first R package, code may be fairly buggy.
If you are attempting to run dmrscaler for your own project and are experiencing issues, feel free
to contact the author or report an issue on the github. The author is still on the steep side of the
R learning curve so patience is appreciated :)
